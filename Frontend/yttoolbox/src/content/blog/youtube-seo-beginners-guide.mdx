# YouTube SEO Fundamentals

YouTube is the second largest search engine in the world, making SEO crucial for getting your content discovered. Understanding how YouTube's algorithm works can dramatically increase your video's visibility and reach.

## Keyword Research

Start by identifying what your target audience is searching for. Use YouTube's autocomplete feature, check competitor videos, and utilize tools like Google Trends and TubeBuddy to find relevant keywords with good search volume.

## Optimizing Video Titles

Your title should include your primary keyword naturally while being compelling enough to encourage clicks. Keep it under 60 characters to avoid truncation in search results.

## Description Optimization

Use the first 100-150 characters wisely as this appears in search results. Include your primary keyword within the first 25 words and provide a detailed, helpful description that encourages engagement.

## Tags and Hashtags

Use a mix of broad and specific tags. Include your primary keyword, variations, and related terms. Hashtags should be relevant and not excessive - 3-5 well-chosen hashtags are usually sufficient.

## Engagement Signals

YouTube values engagement. Encourage likes, comments, and shares. Respond to comments promptly and create content that sparks discussion. Higher engagement signals to YouTube that your content is valuable.
